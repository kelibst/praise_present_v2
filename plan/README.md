# PraisePresent Rebuild - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation roadmap for rebuilding PraisePresent with a PowerPoint-inspired rendering architecture. The rebuild addresses performance and reliability issues by implementing a shape-based content model with hardware-accelerated rendering.

## Architecture Philosophy

The new system is based on Microsoft PowerPoint's proven rendering approach:

- **Shape-Based Content Model**: Everything (text, images, backgrounds) is treated as a composable shape
- **Template System**: Slide masters define consistent layouts for different content types
- **Multi-Display Pipeline**: Separate rendering contexts for operator and live displays
- **Hardware-Accelerated Rendering**: Canvas/WebGL for smooth, professional performance
- **Pre-rendering & Caching**: Background preparation ensures seamless live presentation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**File**: `phase-1-foundation.md`

Core rendering engine and shape system establishment.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Base Shape class hierarchy
- Canvas rendering engine
- Basic shape types (Rectangle, Text, Image)
- Core rendering pipeline

### Phase 2: Templates (Weeks 3-4)
**File**: `phase-2-templates.md`

Slide master template system for church content types.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Template base classes
- Song slide templates
- Scripture slide templates
- Announcement templates
- Template inheritance system

### Phase 3: Live Display (Weeks 5-6)
**File**: `phase-3-live-display.md`

Multi-window presentation system with operator controls.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Multi-display manager
- Live display window
- Operator control interface
- Real-time synchronization

### Phase 4: Content Management (Weeks 7-8)
**File**: `phase-4-content-management.md`

Integration with existing Prisma database models.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Database adapters
- Content transformation layer
- Dynamic slide generation
- Live content updates

### Phase 5: Performance (Weeks 9-10)
**File**: `phase-5-performance.md`

Optimization, caching, and advanced features.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Slide caching system
- Pre-rendering pipeline
- Transition effects
- Performance monitoring

## Architecture Visualization

See `architecture.mermaid` for a comprehensive visual diagram of the system architecture, component relationships, and data flow.

## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration**: 10 weeks
**Milestone Reviews**: End of each phase
**Testing**: Continuous integration throughout
**Documentation**: Updated with each phase completion

## Getting Started

1. Review the architecture diagram in `architecture.mermaid`
2. Start with Phase 1 foundation implementation
3. Follow the detailed phase documents in sequence
4. Test thoroughly at each phase boundary
5. Update documentation as implementation progresses

## Success Criteria

- Smooth 60fps presentation rendering
- Sub-100ms slide switching performance
- Reliable multi-display synchronization
- Intuitive operator interface
- Robust content management integration
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%)
