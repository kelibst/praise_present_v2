## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Rendering Pipeline Optimization

#### Frame Rate Targets
- **Primary Goal**: 60fps at 1920x1080
- **Minimum Acceptable**: 30fps under load
- **Optimization Threshold**: 45fps triggers quality reduction
- **Recovery Target**: Return to 60fps within 2 seconds

#### Hardware Acceleration
- GPU rendering for all visual elements
- WebGL shader optimization
- Memory bandwidth optimization
- Thermal throttling adaptation

#### Memory Management
- Efficient texture streaming
- Background garbage collection
- Memory pool allocation
- Leak detection and prevention

### Caching Strategies

#### Predictive Pre-Loading
```typescript
interface PredictiveCache {
  analyzeUsagePatterns(): UsagePattern[]
  predictNextContent(currentSlide: SlideData): ContentPrediction[]
  preloadPredictedContent(predictions: ContentPrediction[]): void
  adaptToMemoryPressure(availableMemory: number): void
}
```

#### Cache Hierarchies
1. **L1 Cache**: Current and next slide (always resident)
2. **L2 Cache**: Service content (session-persistent)
3. **L3 Cache**: Frequently used content (cross-session)
4. **L4 Cache**: Disk-based asset cache

#### Cache Warming Strategies
- Service start pre-warming
- Background content analysis
- Usage pattern learning
- Predictive asset loading

### Visual Effects System

#### Transition Library
- **Fade**: Smooth cross-fade between slides
- **Slide**: Directional slide transitions
- **Zoom**: Scale-based transitions
- **Morph**: Shape-to-shape transformations
- **Custom**: Church-specific branded effects

#### Performance-Optimized Effects
- GPU-accelerated rendering
- Efficient blending modes
- Minimal memory allocation
- Interruptible animations

#### Effect Configuration
```typescript
interface TransitionConfig {
  type: TransitionType
  duration: number // milliseconds
  easing: EasingFunction
  customParameters?: Record<string, any>
}
```
